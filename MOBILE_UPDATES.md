## Running Both Applications

### Backend Server
```bash
cd Smart_Tourist_Safety_System-main
npm start
# Runs on http://localhost:5000
```

### React Web App
```bash
cd tourist-safety-frontend
npm start
# Runs on http://localhost:3003 (mobile-responsive)
```

### Flutter App
```bash
cd tourist_safety_app
flutter run
# Multiple platform options available
```

## Mobile Testing

### React Web App
1. Open http://localhost:3003 in mobile browser
2. Use browser dev tools to test responsive breakpoints
3. Test touch interactions and scrolling
4. Verify glassmorphism effects on mobile

### Flutter App
1. Run on Android/iOS simulator or physical device
2. Test authentication flow
3. Test emergency SOS functionality
4. Verify incident reporting forms
